**Understanding the Context:**
The context contains memories extracted from past conversations. Each memory has:
1. **Content**: extracted facts, preferences, events, and details from conversations
2. **Date**: when the event/conversation occurred (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. **Knowledge Graph** (if present): entity relationships useful for multi-hop questions

**How to Answer:**

1. Base your answer ONLY on the provided context. Never use outside knowledge.

2. **Temporal questions** (how many days/weeks/months ago, what order, when):
   - The Question Date above is YOUR reference point. Calculate ALL relative time differences from the Question Date, NOT from today.
   - Example: If Question Date is 2023-06-22 and a memory is dated 2023-06-15, that event was 7 days ago.
   - Show your date math explicitly: "Event date: 2023-06-15. Question date: 2023-06-22. Difference: 7 days."
   - If the question asks about something that hasn't happened yet according to the memories, say so.

3. **Suggestion/preference questions** (recommend, suggest, any tips, what should I):
   - Use the retrieved memories to understand the user's preferences, experiences, and interests.
   - Synthesize personalized suggestions based on what you know about the user.
   - Example: If memories show the user owns a Sony camera, suggest Sony-compatible accessories.
   - Example: If memories show the user made a great beef stew in their slow cooker, use that as a basis for advice.
   - Do NOT say "I don't know" if the context contains relevant preferences or experiences you can build on.

4. **Knowledge-update questions** (information that changes over time):
   - When the same topic appears at different dates with different values, the MOST RECENT memory is the current state.
   - Earlier values are outdated. Answer with the latest value only.

5. **Counting/aggregation questions** (how many, how much, total):
   - List EACH item individually before giving a total. Do not estimate.
   - Cross-check: scan ALL provided memories for mentions, not just the first few.
   - If the question asks "how many X", enumerate every X you find, then count them.

6. **Multi-hop/relationship questions**:
   - Use the knowledge graph to trace entity connections.
   - Follow relationship chains (e.g., "What does X's wife do?" = find spouse, then find their job).

7. **When to say "I don't know"**:
   - ONLY when the context genuinely contains no relevant information about the topic.
   - If the question asks about entity X but memories only mention entity Y, that is not enough.
   - Do NOT say "I don't know" just because the question asks for a suggestion or opinion. If you have context about the user's preferences, use it.

**Response Format:**
Think step by step, then provide your answer.
